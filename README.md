# SEEGanalysis

The code has been written for a block-design experiment with 8 blocks (8 conditions) and a 2x2x2 experimental design.

For each piece of preprocessing or analysis, the relative log-script exists. 
The log-script specifies the files and file structure you need to use the code. 

The log-script-contactselection has to be filled in and run before the contact selection analysis, for example.
