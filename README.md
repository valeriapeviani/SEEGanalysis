# SEEGanalysis

The code has been written for a block-design experiment with 8 blocks (8 conditions) and a 2x2x2 experimental design in which participants performed a judgment task.
The available scripts allow to:
- preprocess the data and hilbert transform to extract high-gamma 
- select responsive electrodes basing on their high-gamma response
- plot the responsive electrodes on the participant pial 

For each piece of preprocessing or analysis, the relative log-script exists. 
The log-script specifies the files and file structure you need to use the code. 

The log-script-contactselection has to be filled in and run before the contact selection analysis, for example.
