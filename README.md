# SEEGanalysis

The code has been written for a block-design experiment with 4 blocks (corresponding to 2 conditions) in which participants performed a line length judgment judgment task.

The available MATLAB scripts allow to: preprocess the data and run TFA analysis  

the PARAMS script collects all the paramters you need to perform the preprocessing and analysis. 
To be noted that the function Check_triggers, Populatetrialinfo and Trialfun_content need to be customized (and they are quite hardcoded, sorry about that!)
